# SUK AUTH VALIDATION
## Sign Up/Sign In

### Key Points:
- GUI experience
- Strict Validation by Regular Expressions/Regex.
- Password Hashing for extra Security.
- SMTP for Sending Mail.
- CURD operations, _(Update and Delete are not completed!)_

### Dependencies
- `Python 3 or newer` -> Python Programming Language, version 3 or newer
- `tkinter` -> It is for GUI, `pip install tk`
- `requests` -> It is for **get**, **post**, **put** and **delete** operations via *Sheety ENDPOINT*, `pip install requests`
- `bcrypt` -> For the Hashing of the Password, `pip install bcrypt`


#### Setup steps:
1. Install Python 3.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Create a blank folder
4. Put all given files in this repository (README.md is not necessary) to new created folder.
5. Change SMTP server, SMTP port(*make sure that your port code should be for SSL*), SMTP service email and password constant in `main.py` according to you.
6. Change Sheety End Point in `main.py`. visit [Sheety](https://sheety.co/).
6. Open **cmd** or **terminal** in the same folder.
7. type `python main.py`, then script will start running

*Note: This is not complete, I will make it more better. Update and Delete Operations are 60% completed that will be upload soon.
Code quality is slight lower than good but I will make it an absolute master piece*
